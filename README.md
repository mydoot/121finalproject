# Tools and materials

Engine: We currently intend to use a javascript/typescript framework like Three.js/Ammo.js. We may also switch over to GameMaker Studio or Godot.

Language: Javascript, Typescript when using a JS/TS framework, but if we decide to use other engines like GMS or Godot, we may use their built-in languages (GameMakerScript or GDScript)

Tools: We plan to use VSCode for our IDE. Other tools like Adobe Photoshop and Blender may be used in order to create our assets, as they are free to access (We students get a free Adobe subscription, and Blender is free) and are also powerful tools for their jobs.

Generative AI: We might use generative AI and agentic coding tools in order to help be productive on the project. It will be especially helpful when setting up the project as well.


# Outlook

We hope to create an interesting game that applys the topics we've learned in class. Properly applying these practices (like refactoring) might prove difficult, but with the plethora of tools we have available (even including tools we are not aware of at this time), it should not as difficult or tedius as it seems.
